 # Final assigment - What is Data Science?

### Introduce yourself and share with your peers your background and any experience you have with data science

Hello colleagues, my name is Jivthesh, I'm Indian and I'm 24 years old. I have completed my studies in CSE-COMPUTER SCIENCE ENGINEERING But I Have No Prior Expriences  so my knowledge in the field of data science is quite limited.
I am doing this course since I consider that this field has a great future and i am very interested in learning about python and machine learning.

### Based on the videos and the reading material, how would you define a data scientist and data science?

After reviewing  the material I consider that data science is an interdisciplinary field that involves scientific methods, processes and systems to extract knowledge or a better understanding of data in its different forms, whether structured or unstructured,  which is a continuation of some fields of analysis of data such as statistics, data mining, machine learning and predictive analytics.

Additionally, I considert that  a data scientist is a new profession that today is considered key in the world of technologies. It is a person trained in mathematical sciences and statistics that dominates programming and its different languages, computer science and analytics.
The data science professional must also have the capacity and knowledge to communicate their findings as they have them, not only in the area of technology but also in the business sector. You must master the technology and databases to modify and improve the orientation of the business of the company for which you work.

As discussed in the videos and the reading material, data science can be applied to problems across different industries. What industry are you passionate about and would like to pursue a data science career in?  You must master the technology and databases to modify and improve the orientation of the business of the company for which you work.

There are different applications for this field but i would be intereted in using it in the finance world. For example, you can use machine learning to predict the future value of a certain currency or you can program algorithms to automatically trade stocks.

### Based on the videos and the reading material, what are the ten main components of a report that would be delivered at the end of a data science project?
