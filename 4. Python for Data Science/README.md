# Python-for-Data-Science-and-AI
Repository contains Jupyter notebooks constructed for basic python practice (required especially for data science and ML). These notebooks constitute the lab work required to complete the MOOC on Coursera called 'Python for Data Science & AI'. I am creating this repository also to learn git and github.
